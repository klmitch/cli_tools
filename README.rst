Command Line Interface Tools
============================

The command line interface tools module provides several decorators
which can be applied to a regular function to turn it into a console
script.  It is designed to adapt a function so that it can be used as
a ``console_scripts`` entrypoint.  The decorators allow various
command line arguments to be declared, and for the command line to be
parsed using the ``argparse`` module; the results of the parsing are
then passed to the function as regular keyword arguments.  This does
not interfere with the normal calling conventions of the function; it
can be called from Python code directly.

Simple usage of ``cli_tools``
=============================

The simplest example of using the ``cli_tools`` decorators is as
follows::

    from cli_tools import *

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

In this declaration, the function is defined as taking no arguments
(except ``argparse``'s default of "--help").  The description of the
resulting script will be "Performs an action."

To declare this as an actual console script, the following clause will
need to be added to the ``setup()`` call in your setup.py::

    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'function = your_module:function.console',
        ],
    }

Notice in particular the ".console" appended to the function name.
The decorators add several attributes to the function, including the
callable ``console()``, which performs the actual command line
argument parsing.

The above example is the simplest example, but it would be more
interesting with some defined arguments::

    @argument('--debug', '-d',
              dest='debug',
              action='store_true',
              default=False,
              help="Run the tool in debug mode.")
    @argument('--dryrun', '--dry_run', '--dry-run', '-n',
              dest='dry_run',
              action='store_true',
              default=False,
              help="Perform a dry run.")
    def function(dry_run=False):
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

The first thing to notice is the elimination of the ``@console``
decorator.  It doesn't hurt anything to use ``@console``, but all the
decorators perform the same core actions; as long as one of the other
decorators is used, ``@console`` is unnecessary.

The second thing to notice is that the ``dest`` specified for the
"--dryrun" option matches the only function argument.  When run as a
console script, the value computed from the command line arguments
will be passed as this keyword parameter.

The third thing to notice is that the ``dest`` specified for the
"--debug" option matches no function arguments.  That flag will simply
not be passed to the function.

(As it happens, the ``debug`` argument is treated specially.  Under
normal circumstances, if the function raises an exception, the
exception is coerced to a string, printed to standard error, and then
the console script exits.  If the ``debug`` argument is ``True``,
however, the exception will not be caught, resulting in a print out of
the stack trace.)

Getting a Little More Advanced: Set the Description
===================================================

By default, the first paragraph of the function docstring becomes the
description for the console script, which is printed out when the
"--help" option is given.  This and several other ``argparse`` options
may be overridden using the following decorators:

@prog()
  Overrides the ``prog`` parameter passed to
  ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.  By default, it will be ``None``,
  causing the program name to be derived from ``sys.argv[0]``.

@usage()
  Overrides the ``usage`` parameter passed to
  ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.  By default, it will be ``None``,
  causing the usage message to be automatically computed by
  ``argparse``.

@description()
  Overrides the ``description`` parameter passed to
  ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.  By default, it will be the first
  paragraph of the function docstring.

@epilog()
  Overrides the ``epilog`` parameter passed to
  ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.  By default, it will be ``None``; when
  given, the text will be output at the end of the help text.

@formatter_class()
  Overrides the ``formatter_class`` parameter passed to
  ``argparse.ArgumentParser``.  By default, it will be
  ``argparse.HelpFormatter``.  See the ``argparse`` documentation for
  more details.

Getting More Advanced: Argument Groups
======================================

The ``argparse`` package provides the ability to group arguments.
There are two ways of grouping arguments; in the first, related
arguments are simply grouped together so their documentation is more
easily found, while in the second, a group of arguments are identified
as mutually exclusive.  The ``cli_tools`` decorators accommodate this
by adding a special ``group`` parameter to the ``@argument()``
decorator; this group name identifies a group added using the
``@argument_group()`` or ``@mutually_exclusive_group()`` decorators,
and must be unique.  These latter two decorators take the group name
as the first argument, and remaining keyword arguments are passed to
the underlying ``argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group()`` and
``argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group()`` methods.

Argument Declaration Order
==========================

Arguments and groups are constructed in the order in which they appear
in the file; that is, in the earlier example, the "--debug" option
will be added to the argument parser before the "--dryrun" option.
This is opposite the normal decorator rules, but simplifies setting up
the arguments, particularly positional arguments.

Processors
==========

Some functions can't act as stand-alone console scripts without some
sort of setup.  For instance, it may be necessary to configure
logging.  This can be handled by declaring a processor::

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

    @function.processor
    def _processor(args):
        logging.basicConfig()

Here we declare the function ``_processor()`` as a processor for the
console script ``function()``.  After the command line arguments are
parsed, ``_processor()`` will be called with those arguments; after it
returns, ``function()`` will be called.

It is also possible to perform actions after the function returns.
Consider the following example::

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...
        return result

    @function.processor
    def _processor(args):
        result = yield
        print result
        yield None

Here we turn ``_processor()`` into a generator; the result of the
first ``yield`` statement is the return value of ``function()``, which
we can see will be whatever result it computed.  Thus,
``_processor()`` will print out that result, then yield ``None``--this
is needed so that the script exits without any errors; a non-``None``
value is interpreted as an error condition by the machinery
surrounding the ``console_scripts`` endpoint.

Generator-based processors also receive any exceptions thrown by the
function, like so::

    class BailoutException(Exception):
        pass

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...
        raise BailoutException("I'm done")

    @function.processor
    def _processor(args):
        try:
            result = yield
        except BailoutException:
            print "All done!"
        else:
            print "Results so far: %s" % result
        yield None

Note the ``try`` block around the first ``yield``, which allows the
processor function to catch this special exception and do something
appropriate.

Argument Hooks
==============

It may be necessary to arbitrarily manipulate the argument parser
before parsing the command line arguments.  For instance, a system
which used pluggable authentication modules may need to allow those
modules to add specific command line arguments.  This can be handled
by declaring an argument hook::

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

    @function.args_hook
    def _hook(parser):
        parser.add_argument(...)

Here we declare the function ``_hook()`` as an argument hook for the
console script ``function()``.  After the declared arguments have been
added to the parser, the hook will be called with the parser (an
``argparse.ArgumentParser`` instance), which it can manipulate in any
way.

It is also possible to manipulate the parser prior to adding the
declared arguments.  Consider the following example::

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

    @function.args_hook
    def _hook(parser):
        parser.add_argument(...)
        yield

Here we turn ``_hook()`` into a generator.  The statements preceding
the first ``yield`` statement will be run immediately before adding
the declared arguments, and can manipulate the parser in any way
necessary.  If manipulation needs to be done after the declared
arguments are added, that can be done in statements following the
``yield`` statement.

Advanced ``cli_tools`` Usage
============================

The ``console()`` function added to the decorated function uses
several other functions for setting up the argument parser
(``setup_args()``), building the keyword arguments to pass to the
underlying function (``get_kwargs()``), and safely calling the
function and handling exceptions (``safe_call()``).  These functions
are provided to allow other consumers to make use of the argument
information.  This could be used to build a "Swiss army knife" command
interpreter, for instance.

In fact, such "Swiss army knife" command interpreters are supported
directly by ``cli_tools``, through the use of such decorators as
``@subparsers()``, ``@load_subcommands()``, and the ``@subcommand()``
argument parser decorator.

We begin by showing how to directly declare one function as a
subcommand of another::

    @console
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        pass

    @function.subcommand
    def subcmd1():
        """
        Performs subcmd1.
        """
        ...

    @function.subcommand('sub2')
    def subcmd2():
        """
        Performs sub2.
        """
        ...

In this example, we have defined two subcommands.  The subcommand
defined by ``subcmd1()`` has a name derived from the function name,
while the subcommand defined by ``subcmd2()`` has its name explicitly
set to "sub2".

To introspect the declared subcommands, use the ``get_subcommands()``
function which is also added to the decorated function.  The
``get_subcommands()`` function returns a dictionary mapping the
subcommand name to the function which implements that subcommand.  For
instance, in the example above, ``function.get_subcommands()`` would
return the dictionary ``{"subcmd1": subcmd1, "sub2": subcmd2}``.

Note that, when using subcommands, the original function will never be
called.  If no subcommand is passed on the command line, the
underlying ``argparse`` module reports an error.

It is also possible to load subcommands using a ``pkg_resources``
entrypoint group, using the ``@load_subcommands()`` decorator like
so::

    @load_subcommands('example.subcommands')
    def function():
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

In this example, all functions listed under the "example.subcommands"
entrypoint group will be added as subcommands of ``function()``, with
the subcommand name being set to the name of the entrypoint.  For
instance, if the following entrypoint entries existed::

    entry_points={
        'example.subcommands': [
            'subcmd1 = your_module:subcommand1',
            'subcmd2 = your_module:subcommand2',
            'subcmd3 = other_module:subcommand3',
         ],
    }

Then in the example above, the three subcommands "subcmd1", "subcmd2",
and "subcmd3" would be defined.  (Carefully note that these
entrypoints are *not* followed by the ".console" that was required in
the "console_scripts" entrypoint.)

As a final point, subcommands are handled by calling the
``argparse.ArgumentParser.add_subparsers()`` method.  This method can
take certain keyword arguments for nicer rendering of the help text;
to set these arguments, use the ``@subparsers()`` decorator::

    @subparsers(title="My subcommands")
    def function():
        """
        Perform an action.
        """
        ...

Argument Completion
===================

The command line interface tools module does not provide any
integration with shell argument completion directly.  However,
``cli_tools`` uses the ``argparse`` module, and any argument
completion framework that works with ``argparse`` can be used with it.
As an example, consider the ``argcomplete`` module; here's an example
of how it might be integrated into a ``cli_tools``-compatible CLI::

    from cli_tools import *
    import argcomplete

    # PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK

    @argument('--debug', '-d',
              dest='debug',
              action='store_true',
              default=False,
              help="Run the tool in debug mode.")
    @argument('--dryrun', '--dry_run', '--dry-run', '-n',
              dest='dry_run',
              action='store_true',
              default=False,
              help="Perform a dry run.")
    def function(dry_run=False):
        """
        Performs an action.
        """
        ...

    @function.args_hook
    def _hook(parser):
        argcomplete.autocomplete(parser)

Note the use of an argument hook to invoke the
``argcomplete.autocomplete()`` function; for ``argcomplete``, this
performs the actual argument completion.  Also note the comment
containing ``PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK``, which enables ``argcomplete``'s
global completion mode.
